Almost everything in vim is done by using commands, and it's usually said that you gotta read manual before being able to even close the program. 
That's kind of true, but you don't really have to learn a lot of stuff to be able to use it when you need it.

How to close vim
* type colon q and exclamation mark and intro to exit, like this: _:q!_ and then hit _Intro_ to quit.

How to open vim
* Just type vim and hit enter, that will allow you to check vim out. 
* If you want to open vim and start writing on a specific file, type vim and then a new file name from your prompt, like this: _vim new_file_name.txt_ and then hit _Intro_.

What if you want to save your changes before exiting vim?
* type colon x and you'll exit after saving, like this: _:x_ and then hit _Intro_ to save and quit. 
* If you started vim without specifying a file name, vim will ask you for a name to save the file as before closing down.

Search something

* Stand on a word and type _n_ if you want to search fordward, or _shift + n_ if you wand to search backwards.
